## Pinia vs. Vuex


Vuex works well with any version of Vue, there are several simplifications with Pinia that make the development experience simpler and the resulting code easier to read and understand.


Vuex has different versions depending on the version of Vue that is being used: 
Vuex 4.x works with Vue 3; 
Vuex 3.x works with Vue 2. 

In contrast, Pinia works with both Vue 2 and Vue 3.

Finally, Pinia is the recommended state management library for Vue.
