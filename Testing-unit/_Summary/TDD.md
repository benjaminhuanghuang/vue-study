## From Testing Vue.js Application 1.2
My general approach to writing a Vue component follows:
1 Decide the components I need.
2 Write unit tests and source code for each component.
3 Style the components.
4 Add snapshot tests for the finished components.
5 Test the code manually in the browser.
6 Write an end-to-end test.
