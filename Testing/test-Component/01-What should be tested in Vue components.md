# What should be tested in Vue components

- Test the input: 
    - Props
    - User action
    - Store(Vuex, Pinia)
    - Lifecycle function

- Test the output:
    - Test rendered text, DOM attributes, CSS, inline style
    - Test sub-component existence
    - Vue Event
    - Function should be called

- Test the behavior
    - Test component methods
    - Test event
    - Wait for the DOM to update
    - Wait promises
    - To test a function is called, make sure resource like timer is removed.
    - Test functions are called in lifecycle 
    - Mock HTTP request

2. What to test in a component test?
A Vue.js component typically includes the following to be tested:

Properties (props): Testing how the component behaves when passed different props, and how it handles missing or invalid props.

Data: Testing how the component behaves when the data is changed and how it responds to different states.

Computed properties: Testing how the component behaves when computed properties are updated, and how they depend on other properties and data.

Methods: Testing how the component behaves when its methods are called, and how they interact with the componentâ€™s state and props.

Events: Testing how the component behaves when it emits events, and how it responds to events emitted by its child components.

DOM: Testing how the component renders, and how it updates the DOM when its state or props change.

Lifecycle hooks: Testing how the component behaves when its lifecycle hooks are called, and how it interacts with the Vue.js instance.

Integration: Testing how the component interacts with other components, services, and/or libraries, it can be optional though.

Error handling: Testing how the component handles errors, and how it behaves when it encounters unexpected situations.
