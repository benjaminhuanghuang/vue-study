# What is Vuex

Vuex is a library for managing global state.

It serves as a `centralized store` for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.



Vuex is a state-management library that solves the problem of coordinating state between components.

Vuex uses a one-way data flow pattern to make the flow of data easy to reason about.
