Composition API is a built-in feature of Vue 3 and Vue 2.7. For older Vue 2 versions, use the officially maintained @vue/composition-api plugin. In Vue 3, it is also primarily used together with the `<script setup>` syntax in Single-File Components

setup() is a special hook dedicated for the Composition API.
