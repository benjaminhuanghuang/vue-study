Key Features of Cypress:
End-to-End Testing: Cypress allows you to write tests that simulate real user interactions with a web application. You can visit pages, click buttons, type into fields, and check that the application behaves as expected.

Integration and Unit Testing: Although it's primarily known for end-to-end testing, Cypress can also be used for integration and some unit testing of components, particularly in frameworks like Vue and React.

Fast Feedback and Real-Time Reloading: Cypress tests run directly in the browser and provide real-time feedback. Whenever changes are made, tests are automatically re-executed, speeding up the development cycle.

Time Travel: Cypress captures snapshots of your application at each step of the test. This allows you to "time travel" through your tests and see exactly what happened at each point.

Automatic Waiting: Cypress automatically waits for elements to be visible, animations to complete, or network requests to finish before interacting with the page. This removes the need for adding manual wait statements and makes tests more reliable.

Debugging Capabilities: Cypress has excellent debugging tools, with full access to the developer tools in the browser. It shows detailed logs and allows for debugging directly within the browser, making it easier to fix issues when a test fails.

Cross-Browser Testing: Cypress supports running tests across multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Electron.

Built-In Assertions: It comes with built-in assertions that allow you to easily verify whether a specific condition is met, such as whether an element is visible or a text exists on the page.
